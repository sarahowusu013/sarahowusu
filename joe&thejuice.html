My journey designing t-shirts for Joe began when my sister asked me to create a design for her team. Later, after joining the company, a new rule required us to wear only Joe-themed graphic tees. However, many employees didn’t have these tees, and the company wasn’t providing them.

So, I took matters into my own hands and started designing shirts for my team. The response was fantastic—people loved the designs! Eventually, the company even held a Christmas t-shirt competition, where I earned second place.
