        <h2>☆Graphic Designer★</h2>
    <main>
      <p>
  I’m Sarah Owusu, a London-based graphic designer and graduate of Camberwell College of Arts. My work merges expressive visuals inspired by fashion, music, and storytelling. I started as a painter, transitioned to photography, and now combine various disciplines to push the boundaries of design.

Recently, I’ve been exploring coding to create interactive visuals that actively involve viewers in the design process. One of my latest projects, Emotions, lets users experience the connection between sound, emotions, and their visual representation through shapes and colors.

I’ve also coded my portfolio to reflect everything I stand for—my passion for storytelling, experimentation, and challenging creative limits.      </p>
