        Hello Iâ€™m Sarah Owusu, a London based Graphic Designer who has studied
        at Camberwell College of Arts. My practice examines the form of
        expressive visuals to create an impact on individual behaviour. With
        this, I explore different materials and techniques as from my experience,
        thereâ€™s no limitation to design. My recent interest has been coding as
        it can be used to produce unusual, interactive visuals and invite the
        viewer to be a part of the design. I generally
        value the storytelling of visuals as they captivate the heart and itâ€™s a
        language that everyone can understand.
