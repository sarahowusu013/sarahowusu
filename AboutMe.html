    <main>
      <p>
        I’m Sarah Owusu, a London-based Graphic Designer and Camberwell College of Arts graduate.
        My work blends expressive visuals inspired by fashion, music, and storytelling.
        starting as a painter, then moving into photography, I now embrace multiple disciplines to challenge the boundaries of design.
 Lately, I've been exploring coding to create interactive visuals that draw viewers into the design process.
        My recent project, Emotions, allowed users to explore the connection between sound, emotions, and how they're expressed through shapes and colours.
        I've also coded my portfolio, aiming to showcase everything I've expressed here - my passion for storytelling, experimentation, and pushing creative limits.
