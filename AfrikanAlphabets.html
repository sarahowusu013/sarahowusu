        These posters were inspired by the book 'Afrikan Alphabets: The Story of
        Writing in Afrika' which Saki Mafundikwa wrote. In this book, Mafundikwa
        shows the different African writing systems hidden away from use and not
        mentioned in the graphic design history books. Because of this, he
        encourages people to use their African heritage to create something
        culturally relevant. I was always taught the same designers and never
        about black art growing up. so, I never really knew or saw designers
        like me. So after hearing about Mafundikwa and all the African alphabets
        he’s discovered, I've decided to create posters using different African
        writing systems to show the missing history of typography and let people
        know that this is happening. By doing this, I used letters that looked
        recognizable to write a message but kept the original saying of the
        letter to show that it's not English. I’ve Incorporated Ankara Prints to
        make it clear to the viewers that this is about the African culture as
        their design of colours and patterns are well known.
