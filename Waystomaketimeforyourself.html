        This project was about ‘Connecting Communities’ so I made an animation
        showing ways to make time for yourself to bring positivity on social
        media. During the lockdown, a lot of people have been dealing with their
        mental health so I wanted to remind people that self-care is key. This
        animation receives a satisfactory response on social media as it
        continues to be watched.
