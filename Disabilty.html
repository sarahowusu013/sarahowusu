        These posters were created along with an interactive booklet to inform
        people about the various disabilities and their effect on the
        individual with the condition and what people can do to stay mindful of
        the different needs of the disabilities. This was a collaboration with
        UAL students who studied a different course, but we all managed to work
        together well. We chose this topic because people with disabilities are
        often viewed as one group that includes all forms of disabilities.
        However, the community of people with disabilities is a diverse group
        with various needs. Many disabilities are visually
        apparent whilst others are not as evident known as invisible
        disabilities. We named the booklet ‘Stay Mindful’, which can be
        downloaded below. Through these posters, I wanted to show that people
        with disabilities are often mistreated because they are different from
        what society wants them to be. However, they are still able to achieve
        things like everyone else.
