        This is the second part of the 'Emotions' project where I have coding a
        interactive website to explores the visuals of sounds and how it helps
        depict our emotions. It was really important to me to get people involved since sounds impact everyone's behaviour as in our emotional state. The website was strongly inspired by my childhood of using the windows media player visualisations which display colours, shapes, and patterns that move to the music being played. At that time, it made my experience of listening to music more fascinating and enjoyable.

        <div class="wfee"> <p>Emotions: When we
        feel emotions, we go up and down, flowing like the ocean as we feel it
        all. But every waves has a purpose for our journey for the better. We
        are told that some are good ones and some are bad ones but we need them
        both for different season and reason. It’s important to feel emotions
        because it colours our life. It’s from emotion is where so many songs
        has been written. It’s from sadness is where we can connect to other
        people’s pain. It’s from joy that we feel grateful for life. Emotions is
        an understanding of the human experience. So for what ever emotions you
        feel right now should be embrace as it’s a gift to others. Put your
        emotion in everything you say and do to create connection because we
        need the emotional to be honest without shame. How people feel should be
        the front and centre of conversations.
