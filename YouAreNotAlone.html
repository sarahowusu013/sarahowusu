        This zine was created to help and support people who are dealing with
        challenging environments mentally through the pandemic. I wanted to show
        people that they are not alone and ways to help with having
        anxiety. Augmented reality is used within the 4 illuminations to show
        how invisible anxiety is and how it's important to help one another.
