        This project was on the question of ‘how does sound helps to visually
        depict our emotions?’ And to show this, I created a CD picture booklet
        which represents my upbringing in music and where my love for music came
        from. The picture booklet has colour gradients that each define an
        emotion that we all have gotten when listing to music. There's a QR code
        on the booklet that takes you to the website where you would see a video
        that’s attracted to it which contains the movement and sound of the
        pictures in the booklet. (The website is no longer available!) This work
        overall shows what our emotions could look like and sounds that convey
        that emotional memory. For more, you can read all about my research by
        clicking on the last image.
