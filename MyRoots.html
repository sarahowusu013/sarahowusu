        This typeface was inspired by the book 'Afrikan Alphabets: The Story of
        Writing in Afrika' which Saki Mafundikwa wrote. In this book, Mafundikwa
        shows the different African writing systems that were hidden away from
        use and not mansion in the graphic design history books. Because of
        this, he encourages designs to use our African heritage to create
        something culturally relevant. So I have created this typeface based on
        my roots which is Ghana. To showcase this, I have made an interactive
        book which can only be viewed on the book app on mac showing the
        limitations feeling of African culture designs. The book included
        illustrations made up of the African writing systems as well as the
        typeface that I've created. As for the cover and backgrounds, I used the
        colours of the Ghana flag as it has a deeper meaning to it. ‘Red
        represents the blood of those who died in the country's struggle for
        independence. Gold represents the mineral wealth of the country. Green
        symbolises the country's rich forests. The Black Star stands for the
        lodestar of African Freedom’. As the book is interactive, click on the
        download button below to get the full experience.
